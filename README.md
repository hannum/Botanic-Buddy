# Botanic Buddy
 Innovation Project

How to use

1. Install the expo
==== npm install --global expo-cli

2. Open the project on your code editing. In my case, I'm using VS Code
3. Open the terminal and locate it to the Botanic Buddy project
4. Use this command line for install all the packages:
 ==== npm install
5. If you have Mac, please install the Xcode so we can run the app on the simulator (this app currently is not ready for Android, it might works since we're using React Native, but some components or some features might work different on Android)
6. npm start
